# Customer Insights problem statement

RBS commercial and private banking division supports large corporate client franchise in the UK and Western Europe by delivering innovative solutions in various areas such as  private banking and wealth management, Real Estate, Renewable energy generation and energy efficiency  to name a few.One of the possibilities in helping our customers serve better and more innovatively is to implement a machine learning and data analytics based system that could analyze the publicly available data of our customers' customers and postulate actionable insights and match them with RBS offerings in form of recommendations.
 
One of the examples of such an observation subject could be -

<ul> 
<li>RBS Customer (RC)- A restaurant
<li>Customers of our customer(Transitive customers TC) -  People who avail services of this restaurant
<li>Input Data - Available data about TC -

                        <li>RBS In-house data(I) - e.g. transaction data of these customers if they are already customers of RBS
                        <li>Data from our customers(D) - e.g. any data that RC can provide about TC
                        <li>Any other publicly available data(P)
                        <li>RBS Service offerings(O) - RBS service offerings which can enhance service offerings of RC
</ul>                              
<li>Outcome -

                <li>Generate recommendations based on generated hypotheses and RBS service offerings ( R which will be a function of H and O).
